# About
This project aims to teach students of varying ages about the basics of computers and Artificial intelligence.

## Structure
There are 2 separate websites as part of this project. `demo.html` is the website that is part of the installations in Offerdahl West and the Quentin Burdick Building. `demo-elementary.html` has the same content as `demo.html`, but is geared towards a younger audience, namely, elementary and middle school students, whereas `demo.html` is for prospective and current students.

## Content
Both websites are built on HTML5 and Bootstrap 5.3. The general layout includes pre-expanded accordion items to separate content with a sleep screen that activates on page load and after a 3 minute inactivity timeout.
